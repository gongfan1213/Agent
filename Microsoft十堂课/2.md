Lesson 2 Which agent framework to use
what are agentic frameworks why do we use them and how to decide which one to choose we're going to answer these questions in the second lesson of the AI agents for beginners course in this course we take you from concept to code covering the fundamentals of building AI agents and in this short video actually follows along with the written lesson including translations and a code sample which you can find at the link above and below this video so let's start by defining what agentic frameworks are and these are tools that enable anyone building AI agents to have a bit more control over task management because as mentioned in the first lesson agents are focused on completing tasks and we'll talk a bit more about this in our multi- aent chapter but for some use cases we need multiple agents working on a set of tasks and agentic frameworks help us to decide what agent will complete that task also contextual understanding see agents need to have information about the context and environment state if an agent for example is to book a hotel room it needs to know that there are hotel rooms available to book so Agentic frameworks allow us to better manage this context also agent collaborations See how these agents complete the task together is up to us to define and agentic frameworks allow us to do that more effectively they create spaces and use protocols to allow agents to communicate between each other these frameworks also come with tools or connections to allow us to observe and evaluate our agents performance so which one should you choose there are many out there and in this course we have focused on three different agentic frameworks and services so you can get a better understanding how they work first is the Azure AI agent service this currently is only designed to be a sing used for single agents both through code and the UI and it integrates really well with existing Azure services and capabilities you might be already using we also off use two different agentic frameworks semantic kernel and autogen both these frameworks can utilize agents built with the Azure ai agent service as well as other services like GitHub models which we have code samples for throughout this lesson semantic kernel on one hand is an enterprise focused framework and the team behind it are really focused on a developer experience for teams building AI agents in production it offers support for C Java and Python and a variety of different connectors to other model services we also have Autogen which was born teams in Microsoft research has a strong focus on taking the latest in aentic research and enabling other researchers and developers to test and experiment with those ideas in code and as always the best advice is to start small working with one agent through something like the Azure AI agent service and then when you have an agents working you can combine them by using one of the frameworks that has multi- aent support like semantic kernel or autogen depending if you're building for production or just exploring the latest in aentic research with autogen we have more information on how to decide which tool is right for you in the written lesson and while listening to someone talk about this is helpful thanks for watching by the way getting hands-on is the best way to get a better understanding of how these tools work so let's head over to our code editor and to do so so now we're here back at our code editor and we have three different samples one using semantic kernel autogen and the Azure AI agent service as mentioned you can find this code at the link above and below the video to run it yourself we'll start with the semantic kernel example this is something we already kind of ran in the last lesson where you we be be able to define different plugins in this case we have this destinations plugin which takes a list of different destinations and allows a random destination to be returned whenever a user is asking for a planning of a trip and again we're defining that agent using a chat chat completion agent the kernel so everything that we've been adding so all the services and tools uh we have some instructions and then any other settings additional settings that we need and basically we're going down here we can see the uh that the user is planning a day we can also see that it's actually making a call to that function so get random destination uh and then getting the result which is New York and then the agent is going ahead and then taking that information from that function and making a plan for New York sounds like a lovely trip on the autogen side a similar sort of setup uh in this case we're going to uh create a client which is a the check completion of the model behind it we can also do some different settings whether it's like a JSON output which is really important when we're talking about doing different working with different functions on different parts of our system and then we can define the agent in a way where you we have the name of the agent the model client that we just defined we don't have any tools here but this is where Autogen allows us to define any custom tools and then lastly the system message which is similar to Samantha Colonel's agent instructions in this case we're just going to ask the for a great sunny vacation uh so giving the agent a little bit more details here on you know the type of vacation that we want to have uh and then we see uh you know the interaction the agent comes back or the assistant comes back with the plan and it's you know 7-day trip to Maui sounds lovely so and lastly we're going to look at the Azure AI agent service so again this is your first time seeing this service we have a setup video uh that will actually show you how to set up these connection strings cuz this is how we're using this agent uh through the project that we've made in the Azure AI Foundry and with the azure AI agent service it's a little different setup in this case we're going to create an agent kind of at the runtime in terms of interactions with the user we're going to create a thread and a thread basically is the setup between uh the messages that are being collected between the user and the agent and in this case we're going to start with the user's interaction asking for a bar chart of you know with the different amount of travelers and destinations and the way that we're kind of also focusing on this as a uh in terms of the ability for the agent to use that is that we have different tools built into the Azure AI agent service and in this case we have the code interpreter tool so this allows the agent to generate some code and in this case it's going to generate some Python code uh to actually generate bar chart so we we see this thread and then we have this run status so this is actually the uh interactions between once the agent start running the different tools and then we can see that it's actually created an image um and then we can even display that image right below here with a bar chart uh with the amount of the destination and the amount of travelers so go in look at the code samples play around with different settings and like I said we're going to be running different samples throughout this course so you can really see the differences between the different services and frameworks that we're offering in this course but we'll see you in the next lesson
