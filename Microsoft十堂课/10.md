Lesson 10 How to deploy AI agents intro production
production effectively what are some uncommon mistakes and how can we fix them and what are some ways we can manage the cost we're going to cover these questions in the 10th lesson of the AI agents for beginners course in this course we take you from concept to code covering the fundamentals of building AI agents in this short video that follows along with the written lesson including translations and code samples that you can find at the link above and below this video but let's talk about getting AI agents into production and into our users and customers hands and that journey begins with evaluations of your AI agents to evaluate AI agents properly you need to look at the entire system that the AI agent operates in and set up evaluation points at each step this includes but not limited to the initial request to the large language model or service making sure you have a proper connection response times and model selection and how this might affect affect responses over time
then the agent's ability to identify the intent of the user which is helpful to make sure your agent has the ability to complete the task that's been requested then the agent's ability to identify the right tools to perform that task so that the agent is achieving the goal of the user
also the tools response to the agent's request things to consider here are any errors or malformed responses from those tools or perhaps uptime issues with the service if you're using an external service then also being able to collect the feedback of the agents response is also a part of evaluations this includes providing a UI fe or feedback mechanisms in the UI like a thumbs up thumbs down or how the users are satisfied with the responses as well as using manual evaluation as well as nlms to judge responses and having evaluation at every step of the workflow enables us to both see changes over time and it allows us to make changes to our agentic system things like changing the model or different services for tools and we can better identify the effects of these changes because we're evaluating at every step and the next step of this lesson like all the other lessons before it is to head over to our code editor and see this in action okay so welcome to chapter 10 and this code sample which again can be found at the top of the GitHub repo the link above and below this video so you've probably seen this code this sample before if you followed along with all of the lessons uh cuz we have this kernel fun this kernel function or function call that we have which is about getting destinations so these are destinations available and we also have the get flight times but the difference of this one and I want to kind of mimic scenario that you might experience when launching AI agents into production is that when we make this call we're actually going to get this HTTP error for four uh because flight times aren't currently available so again if we're using an external service we might experience this because maybe our credentials are expired or the service is down so we need to make sure that we have a way to then allow the agent to continue to operate and continue to use whatever tools that are available in this case we're essentially going to just replace that with a get flight times backup that should have also the same you know the flight times that we expect uh when a user asks that then you can maybe even also has instructions on what you know even directing the agent if the service is down how to handle those errors in this case what we we we are going to do is actually define this get flight times function as well as this get flight times backup and define this as a backup function uh for flight times and then you know if flight time service is down we're also going to make sure uh that it knows that it can start using this backup flight times so again we're not uh you establishing these grand rules in terms of error handling but you can do that in terms of especially when you're operating with multiple different services out there
so what this interaction should look like is you know we have this user input which is book me a flight to Barcelona so again this is the request from the user and we can actually see I drilled down here about the function calls that it makes so first it's going to try the get flight times uh you know passing in the destination Barcelona and what we get this http4444 error so next request is to get flight times back up which luckily that service isn't down or has no errors so then we're going to get this flight times back up and these flight times and be able to send that to the user so this is just one scenario and one type of um you know scenario you should prepare for when you're working with AI agents in production we have have a list and a written lesson of other things that you might want to look out for when launching a agent production and this will conclude at least in our initial chapters so uh 10 lessons on AI agents for beginners but we wish you the best of luck and we will continue to improve this course and add more materials as the world of AI agents continues to expand but thank you for watching the lessons
