Lesson 3 How to design good AI agents
what makes for a good AI agent what are some principles for creating them and are there any examples of actually applying these principles we're going to answer these questions in the third lesson of the AI agents for beginners course in this course we take you from concept to code covering the fundamentals of building AI agents and this short video follows along with the written lesson including translations and a code sample that you can find at the link above and below this video but let's get started at what makes a good AI agent and there are three key parts first is space this is the environment that the agent is working in and in this space you should focus on connecting events people and knowledge an agent should be easily discoverable while being able to transition from being in the foreground and background based on the user's needs to apply this principle we can build this in the UI or UX of our applications such as providing basic instructions on how to use the agent like what the agent should be used for and if it has certain limitations second is time this is how the agent operates over time with the user this is important because agents can improve over time if we design them well enough and this can be done through connecting the agent to past events and enabling a reflection design pattern which we'll actually talk about later and implement in a later lesson to apply this principle you can show users their past prompts and inter interactions in the UI to show how the long-term context the agent is actually operating on and lastly is core this principle is about brace embracing uncertainty since we're allowing LLMs to create plans and action on those plans uncertainty is a key part of agentic design enabling trust and transparency with humans users by empowering them with visible controls and feedback tools is really important here much like you have controls over this video like pause play captions and speed control for those like me who watch everything at 2x speed your users should have a similar level of diverse access of controls of an agent like turning it on and off and so let's see how we can actually apply these principles in code okay so we're at our code editor now but we're going to continue from the last two lessons of using this sample using semantic kernel and the GitHub models again this code sample you can run it on your own you can find it at the link above and below this video it's a GitHub repo and just to refresh your mind on what this actually does is it takes a destinations plugin so what semantic kernel uses in terms of different tools and functions that we can call uh again we have a list of these tools I mean sorry destinations that are available um for being able to book a trip and then we also have this function which is basically returning one a random location every time it gets called so in in case to modify this uh to apply to the design principles we just spoke about we want to make it clear to the user about what is this agent is capable of and also give it some suggestions in terms of uh what interactions we would like to see the agent complete so in this case we have a very much a more specific uh agent instructions here both on you know being able to you start the opening interaction that the you're able to plan vacations also giving it kind of some tips around planning a day trip for a specific location allowing you to rand choose a random location or find destinations based on specific features so a user could say that they want to you know travel to the mountains or beaches and then even plan alternative trips if they don't like the the first suggestion so again this is a good agentic design principles because a user kind of knows both the capabilities and the limitations of this agent first as they start to first interact with it uh so if we go in down here to see like what that interaction actually looks like you know the agent comes in starts out with this hello uh you know your travel assistant they help plan vacations gives you a list of things that are capable of and then similar to what we've done before the user says you know plan me a day trip and then they also the agent now that we've given this more a more specific system prompt is going to ask if they want to specify a specific location or you know again the user again from that first interaction can say I just want a random loc uh location in this case the the user goes in says they would like to go to Bali which again sounds like a great place to go and then we get this nice day trip itinerary from the agent so that was how to apply some of the agentic design principles around prompting and being very transparent with the limitations and capabilities of an agent in code and we'll see you in the next [Music]
