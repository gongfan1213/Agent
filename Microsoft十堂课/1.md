Lesson 1 What are AI agents?
what are AI agents what are the best use cases for them and what do we need to start building them we're going to answer these questions in this first lesson of the AI agents for beginners course in this course we're going to take you from concept to code covering the fundamentals of building AI agents and in this short video follows along with the written lesson including translations and a code sample that you can find the link to above and below this video but let's get started looking at the parts of an AI agent and the first part is a large language model which pars the reasoning behind our AI agents and what we mean by reasoning is being able to identify a task requested by users create a plan to complete that task and perform the actions of that plan next up is memory this can be short-term the context of the conversation between the user and the agent or long-term which is a collection of data that allows the agent to improve over time in completing the task after that is tools this can be different services accessed by APIs that perform an action data to help determine what action to take or different functions that we will run to send information to the agent and combining all of these things an agent uses the LLM to recognize the task of the user would want to complete identify what available tools are needed to complete that task and memory to gather the information and data that's needed to complete that task a simple real world example you do every day hopefully is brushing your teeth you need to plan out when and where to do it your tools are your toothbrush and toothpaste and you have some in context memory of the current status of you brushing your teeth and long-term memory maybe your preferences of toothpaste flavor i'm a Spearmet fan myself thanks for asking but we aren't here to brush our teeth we're here to build AI agents so let's head over to the code to do so
okay so now we're here in our code editor to run the first code sample attached to lesson one in this example we're going to actually work with semantic kernel and a gentic framework from Microsoft and GitHub models which gives us free access to large language models if this is the first time you've seen a Jupyter notebook or you if you want to learn how to get set up we actually have a chapter dedicated to setting this up and running the code in the course but we won't focus too much on specifics of semantic kernel in this lesson as the next chapter will be a focus on the different agentic frameworks how they work and their differences and benefits but the first thing I want to point you to is this class destination destinations plugin this is basically where we start to list the functions or tools that we basically want the agent to being called in this case we have an agent that has an availability of different a list basically of different destinations around the world and we also have a function that makes it that each time you call it it will choose a random city out of that list uh and give it to the user or basically return it so we're going to again not really focus too much exactly on how semantic kernel is working but this is the syntax of adding that plugin or adding that tool like we explained earlier agents have access to onto that agent as well as assigning the large language model which in this case I'm going to use GPT40 mini feel free to experiment with different large language models and see how they react so we're going to go ahead and now uh go to the code we're going to actually simulate a little bit of difference like of how a user would be interacting with this agent so the first thing is they're going to ask for a day trip and I think this kind of really illustrates some of the powers of working with large language models is a user can kind of communicate in natural language and not just say I want a vacation for example but a day trip and a large language model should be able to interpret that this is uh asking or maybe requiring calling this function this random destinations because it again the user has not really provided a specific city and the large language model is aware of how uh what uh tools are being assigned to it and And then we're going to also play with a little bit of the memory itself by allowing the user to say they don't like that first destination and they should plan another vacation so if the agent has context again that in context of the memory of the conversations it should not repeat itself on the vacation destination so if we go into um this now interaction we can see the user saying plan me a day trip and then uh the travel agent comes in and says suggest Sydney so again to confirm Sydney is a part of the list of vacation destinations that we assign into the function uh the user says they don't really like this destination and plan me another vacation so sorry anyone watching from Sydney uh but then again though the agent comes back and plans a nice trip to Rio de Janeiro very similar format so again you can see that the agent is operating with that function that returns the cities it's not just pulling it from every city it's aware of uh and it also is working with the context memory to know what the conversation is happening and displaying an alternative so wherever you are I hope you enjoy your trip to Sydney or Rio de Janeiro but our trip on this journey in AI agents beginners goes to lesson two where we'll explore the different aentic frameworks out there see you in the next one
