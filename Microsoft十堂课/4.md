Lesson 4 What is the Agent Tool Use Design Pattern?
lesson what is the tool use design pattern how does it help AI agents do more and what should we plan for when using it to build AI agents we're going to answer these questions in the fourth lesson of the AI agents for beginners course in this course we take you from concept to code covering the fundamentals of building AI agents and in this short video follows along with the written lesson including translations and a code samples that you can find at the link above and below the video so let's get started looking at what the tool use design pattern is and while while LLMs are very effective on their own in generating content tasks that are requested by users sometimes require external tools to complete and the tool design pattern allows the LMS to interact with these tools such as a calculators APIs to tell us about flight status or a function within our application handling currency exchange to understand the benefits of this let's take a look at a few use cases for example an AI agent can create database queries using tools for generating code and a be able to retrieve real-time information from a customer database of the customer's travel loyalty points and travel preferences or an AI agent can be connected to a CRM system and to answer specific questions about a customer's travel booking rather than needing a human intervention to do so and while we've been talking about single-use tools agents can also combine tools in order to automate workflows for example analyzing an email retrieving the relevant B knowledgebased information and then forwarding it that email to customer service representative to make that process more efficient there's a lot to consider when talking about tool calling for example security making sure AI agents have only the type of access required and handling errors because sadly we don't live in a perfect world where the services that the agent might be using are always running maybe one day but we will cover these topics more in depth in our trustworthy AI agents lesson and AI agents in production but let's head over to our code and build a tool calling AI agent okay so now we're at our code editor and we're using the semantic kernel tool example with the notebook again you can find this code at the link above and below this video and we've been covering tool calling in the other lessons as well but I want to show you just a few other kind of options and abilities that we have within this kind of world of tool calling and in this case we have this destinations plugin uh we're g using semantic kernel and we have one that just has a list of destinations that are available basically a list of destinations and then the other one is the actual availability so you can kind of think of this maybe as two different databases or maybe one that has uh you know a list of things that are destinations available and then the current status uh whether they're you know being able to be booked or not so we will also show this in in terms of the function behavior so this is another kind of setting built built into semantic kernel where we can have this either be auto so it basically allows the agent to choose when to call the function or when not to uh whenever whenever it deems it appropriate or we're required when we want to make sure that the agent is calling a function depending on the kind of use case and scenario that we have again we're setting up the agent like before but in this case we want to have three user inputs and I want to show kind of the value of working with tool calling here first the one is the user input the question is you know what destinations are available then it's going to ask about a specific destination and then it's going to ask are there any destinations available not in Europe uh and we can look at the interaction here to see how this goes so first is what destinations are available and as expected this is going to call the get destinations plug-in or function and this result is going to give back our list and then it can go ahead and show that list to the user um and this again is just saying this is just getting the destinations right not just specifically about the availability of them but what ones can I actually book and then it's going to actually the user is going to ask about is Barcelona available so again kind of similarly query but in this case instead of calling the get destinations since it give us a specific destination we can call the get availability and see that the result is that Barcelona is unavailable and the travel agent responds accordingly saying Barcelona is currently unavailable but I want to show this as another kind of example of why uh you know we're not just making API API recalls here but also using the power of large language models to interpret natural language because in this case you know there are there any vacation destinations available not in Europe uh we don't have to as developers are building these agents define which ones are in Europe or not because the large language model has all of that within it sort of base training data so in this case you don't need to have a new function saying is in Europe or not in Europe or anything like that right we can just first that large model is going to call the get availability in this case it already has deemed that Tokyo Japan is not in Europe and that New York uh is not also in Europe but it's going to call that specific uh function the get availability to see which ones are not available and then we get the result for both of them and then perfectly it says that New York is available and also gives an kind of extra information that Tokyo Japan is currently unavailable so again this really shows you the power of using agents large language models to both use their abilities to interpret natural language to have that sort of interaction as well as tool calling to give it the specific data based on that interpretation and that plan from the agent itself so that was tool calling we're going to continue to use this as a feature in other samples but we'll see you in the next lesson
