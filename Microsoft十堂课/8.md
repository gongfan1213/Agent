Lesson 8 How to use a multi-AI agent system
pattern when is a good time to use multiple AI agents instead of one and when is what kind of control and visibility do we have when working with multiple agents we're going to answer these questions in the eighth lesson of the AI agents for beginners course in this course we take you from concept to code covering some of the fundamentals of building AI agents and this is a short video that follows along with the written lesson including translations and code samples that you can find at the link above and below this video to put it simply the multi- aent design pattern is where we have multiple AI agents working together to complete a common goal or task but the real question is how exactly do the AI agents do that and there are different design patterns that apply depending on their goal
there's group chat where just like a group chat with your friends and colleagues every message in the chat is broadcasted to each agent and depending on the contents of that message a group chat manager typically another AI agent will select the appropriate AI agent to handle performing the task for example you might build an airline customer service application where there are separate agents that handle booking or customer complaints or questions about flight status a customer could type their message into the chat and there would be a task request would be routed to the proper agent but there may be scenarios where an AI agent needs information from another AI agent before completing its task and this is called a handoff pattern where there is an AI agent completing each step in a defined workflow before handing it off to the net
and lastly there are cases where you want each AI agent in your application to perform some task and this is called collaborative filtering in this design pattern each agent acts as a specialist in some task or area and responds to that task in their own unique way and this is great when performing some type of analysis where you want different inputs or perspectives on some data and as you can see multi- aent design patterns cover a wide spread of different use cases but let's really see how it works by heading over to our code editor okay so now we're in our code editor looking at the chapter 8 or lesson 8 example again this code sample is available at the GitHub GitHub repo above the link above and below this video in this scenario we're actually going to have two agents one kind of producing content or writing content and another agent reviewing that content so this is kind of the reviewer checker pattern or again utilizing multiple agents to produce a better result in this case we're going to have one reviewer agent which is the concierge and we've given specific instructions to the concierge in terms of uh being able to f both focus on uh recommending recommending non-ouristy experiences for travel so we want kind of this local and authentic experience uh that the a good concier should provide right and then we also got to make sure that uh it doesn't actually uh you know provide any insights uh I mean also just only provides insights on recommendations of improving that suggestion but doesn't provide a specific example so we don't want the you know uh the concier to just make new examples and we because what we would want to happen is we have this other agent which is the front desk agent and we've also given it kind of instructions to provide one single recommendation per response so again allowing the concierge to review that and make any suggestions but not new recommendations but we also then want the uh front desk engine to consider those suggestions and refine uh that idea that they have so in this case uh we're going to say then uh what's maybe new with multi multiple agents here is that we have this termination function and this is going to be a function that we want to that essentially uh terminate the the interactions between the agents in this case we have we've defined that this is going to be when the concier has given approval of the most recent response so the other of the most recent suggestion uh that the front desk when it meets their standards in terms of having a local and authentic experience and then we also have the selection process which is where we're going to define basically how this conversation will take place so we're going to have that you know each participant takes a turn in the next conversation uh we're going to choose from these participants again the reviewer and the which is concierge and the front desk and then we've also defined what's going to happen you know the user is going to have an input or a question it's going to go first to the front desk then the front desk is going to reply then it's reviewer's turn to uh do their instructions which is going to review the front desk suggestions after that uh they're going to provide some feedback and then it's up to the front desk to then uh suggest something new so in this case then we want to go look at what this output will look like and again we have this input and this person would like to go to Paris uh it was a general question and then the front desk is going to recommend the Lou Museum the Louv is uh you know great museum and and the concier recognizes that says you know this is undeniably a worldrenowned site but it's also one of the most popular tourist destinations again we want to give a very local and authentic experience something kind of off the beaten trail in terms of suggestions so go suggesting a lesserk known museum or local art gallery so this is kind of again giving feedback to the front desk and then the uh front desk comes back the front desk agents says visit the museum de launch uh for an intimate experience with Monet's water lily so great the concierge is disapproved which then that terminates our um conversations because now it meets the uh kind of criteria for the concierge and then we can see that this is complete is true this is just one type of pattern that we will have can apply to in terms of using multiple agents uh you can see here now the kind of power between not just having one agent make suggestions and maybe having you know in hoping the user makes feedback but even using an agent to refine those uh results and giving back a better suggestion so that was the end of lesson 8 or terms of multiple agents but see you in lesson [Music]
